# Pancake Rates

Simple App that provides actual rates for [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap) tokens and the most profitable exchange route.

- Implemented necessary utilities for working with blockchain, such as the create2 function, which does not exist on Flutter.
- Developed an algorithm to calculate the most favorable exchange route, extending Dijkstra's algorithm (usually used to calculate the shortest path).
- Designed the UI/UX, implemented the MVVM architecture, and established a JSON RPC connection to a blockchain node.
